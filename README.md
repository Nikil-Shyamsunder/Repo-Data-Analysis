Streamlit dashboard build to present analysis of the kaggle "GitHub Dataset." I used the version 2 dataset, which includes information scraped from 2,917,951 repositories on GitHub. After doing my own data analysis, I compiled findings I thought most important such as popular programming languages, trends in programming languages over time, etc.
